- This was hard.
- Coming up with the idea of recursion on our own seems impossible.
- Trying to get around the issue of "this doesn't work, how do I remove the last
queen and keep going" was particularly hard.
- This recursion feels weird since we started with the base case of working from
the end state of "all queens are there already!", instead of the base case of "
nothing is here, what do?"
