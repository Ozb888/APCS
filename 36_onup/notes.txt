ThinkJava D    ERRORs

3 error types
Compile time      Run Time          Logic

Compile time error
-> Syntax issue, commonly mistypes
TO FIX: go to line, check for instant  mistype 
        -use of semicolon     
        -use of proper camelCase throughout
        -curly bracket opening and closing
        -quotes for strings closed
        -parentheses open and closing
        -etc.
Bisection Debug: separate full code to new file, separate each half in a different file, check which one does not work
                 separet this non wokring code, repeat, continue until error is much more specefied and search.
                 
Dont take computers advice.


Run-time error
 ->Loop/recursion problems (LR) generally infinite, left hanging
 TO FIX: S.O.U.P before and after loops and recursions to see which is the culprit
       -check for lack of base case
       -S.O.U.P methods
       -etc
 output too heavy? comment out some unnecessary S.O.U.P's and simplify code, eliminate experimental or unnecessary lines.
 
 Logic error
 -> Computer runs it: it doesnt do what you wanted it to
 TO FIX: break down code into components
        -remember properties of primitive types
        -inheritence of code
        -Break down expressions to more easily readable and comment outable code, 
        -Return AFTER code of a method (do not compact whole functions on the return line)
        
        
End Case; Go to ducky, explain code and its purpose in depth, see if you spot the issue yourself
         -Step away from the computer for a moment, think about it while away from the computer going though the code in your head
         -Seek help from partners and another set of eyes on your code
